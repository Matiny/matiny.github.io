      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>Computer science is mainly about problem solving and creativity. For most of my life, I've been a big fan of both. It took me many years to realize this, though. In the meantime, I've been a math tournament champion, lover of strategy in games, and an artist. I've always been intrigued by the nitty gritty of the creative process and basic life hacks. Computer science is not only a broad outlet for the aforementioned, but a profitable one.</p>

        <h2>(React, Sass, UI/UX Design, Responsive Design)</h2>
        <p>GTA Online is very detailed, but the details are presented in a confusing way. This app is an
interactive series of concepts that improve upon the game’s UI/UX design flaws.
One of the design problems addressed is the cluttered menus. I came up with various menus
which are simpler to use, while maintaining the same complex functions.</p>
